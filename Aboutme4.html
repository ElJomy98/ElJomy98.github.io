      <p> Even if i was not the smartest kid i made some great thing during my years at school. I was able join the soccer team around 7 to 8 grade since every other places i needed money to play my favorite sport. Around 10 grade i had to leave my soccer team because some transportation issues but a year later i manage to join my school band i that was one of my best choices in life, learn about music and learn how it worked. I lasted 2 years on the band, 1 year with violin other with a flute and everytime we pulled off the concert i was so proud of myself and my group. i finally manage to earn a medal since i was not able to earn one because of grades etc and after that i graduate and join collage and earn a place in National Society Honor for like a year before things became rough in clases, hope you learn a little about me and thanks.</p>
